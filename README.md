# Simulation

•	Used semaphore, thread and synchronization to handle the operation of the simulation. The simulation had five parameters: the number of customers, tables, cooks, type of machines, flag.
•	Built parallel operation allows different cooks, machines can work at the same time on different orders to reduce the waiting time of order and cooking time.
•	Using knowledge of thread, multi-threads and thread safe to complete the project.
